### Week 2 (June 03 - June 09)

Weekly Activity

1. Weekly e-meet: The following topics were discussed:
   - Appearance and functionality of display section. After discussion we concluded to have a simpler interface, displying only the `variables` in the selector. Other global properties would be always visible.
   - Overview and usage of tests.
   - Features and functionality of Fields panel.
2. Implemented simpler interface consisting of Display and description section ([PR #2](https://github.com/intake/xrviz/pull/2)). For more details please refer [Issue #14](https://github.com/intake/intake-gsoc-gui/issues/14) and [Issue #15](https://github.com/intake/intake-gsoc-gui/issues/14). Current status:

3. Started implementation of Basic Fields and Output Panel ([PR#3](https://github.com/intake/xrviz/pull/3)). Current status:

![Basic Fields and Output Panel](assets/06_fields_output.png)


### Week 3 (June 10 - June 16)

Weekly Activity

1. Improved the Basic fields and output panel. Added support for plotting data coordinates with respect to variables, which earlier resulted in errors.
2. Completed implementation of Basic Fields and Output Panel ([PR #3](https://github.com/intake/xrviz/pull/3)). The plotting function has been reimplemented using `sel` method.
3. The following topics were discussed in weekly e-meet:
   - `ignore_events` method present in `dfviz`, can be useful for some interactions in `xrviz`.
   - Demonstrated the working of interface.
   - `convert_widget` function.
   - Way to set/reset variables to coordinates.
   - Aggregation methods ([Issue #21](https://github.com/intake/intake-gsoc-gui/issues/21))
   - Overview of tasks for Phase 2:
       - Style Panel ([Issue #22](https://github.com/intake/intake-gsoc-gui/issues/22))
       - Projection Panel ([Issue #23](https://github.com/intake/intake-gsoc-gui/issues/23))
       - Time series extraction ([Issue #24](https://github.com/intake/intake-gsoc-gui/issues/24))
4. Started implementation of Aggregations in the fields panel ([PR #4](https://github.com/intake/xrviz/pull/4)). Current Status:
  - For single selection

![Aggregations 1 selection](assets/07_agg1.png)

  - For multiple selections
   
![Aggregations 1 selection](assets/08_agg2.png)
![Aggregations 1 selection](assets/09_agg3.png)

### Week 4 (June 17 - June 23)

Weekly Activity

1. Improved the functionality implemented earlier for Aggregations in the Fields panel. Now the user can aggregate along remaining dimensions (not selected in `x` and `y` ). The option to create a `Select` widget or `Animate` is also present in case the user does not wish to apply any aggregation on the dimension. ([PR #4](https://github.com/intake/xrviz/pull/4))

![Aggregations](assets/10_agg_final.png)

2. Implemented functionality to set reset coords ([PR #7](https://github.com/intake/xrviz/pull/7)). User can select and set any variable as a coordinate.

![Set Reset Coords](assets/11_set_coords.png)

3. Modified set reset coords to work with aggregations. The user can have aggregation for a variable along a dimension, even when `x` and `y` Select has `coord` as options.

![Set Reset Coords](assets/12_set_coords.png)

4. Weekly e-meet: The following topics were discussed:
  - Installation package ([PR #8588 · conda-forge](https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/8588))
  - Demonstration of Aggregations ([PR #4](https://github.com/intake/xrviz/pull/4))

  - Generalisability of the interface: In future the dashboard can be used as base by the users, or community to visualise data related to a particular domain such as Astronomy, Oceanography by adding domian specific customisations.
5. XrViz can be installed as a package by `conda install -c conda-forge xrviz`. ([conda-forge/xrviz-feedstock](https://github.com/conda-forge/xrviz-feedstock))
